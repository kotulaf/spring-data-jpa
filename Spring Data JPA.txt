Spring Data JPA - Java Persistence API

implementations:
	hibernate - most popular one, takes a java object and maps java classes (ORM {object relational mapping}) to databases as tables, so we can perform
		    various operations

Reduces the amount of code that has to be written, gives us a lot of generated queries and access to our databases without having to write a single line of code
The implementation with Spring Boot applications is very simple and intuitive 

First we are starting with a bare Spring Boot project
pom.xml is a maven configuration file with e.g. dependencies, the only ones that i care about are org.springframework.boot and org.postgresql

in application.properties we have already some things set up for us, so that makes it easier:
spring.datasource.url - the url of the server
spring.datasource.username - username to connect to the database, no need to specify
spring.datasource.password - the password to the database account, no need to specify
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop - when the program's stopped everything's dropped
spring.jpa.show-sql=true - about the sql statements that hibernate will generate
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect = the dialect used, which is Postgres in our case
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true - we want the SQL to be formatted

We've created a class with some properties, we aren't using Spring Data JPA yet, we'll map it as a table with these annotations: @Entity, @Table
More about these annotations in my first spring boot project

The program is not going to work yet, as we need to determine a primary key, which we can do by using the @Id annotation
we want a BIG SERIAL data for the primary key/id, that's why we will use sequence (in more detail at github/spring-boot-first)
