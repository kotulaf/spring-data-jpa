Spring Data JPA - Java Persistence API

implementations:
	hibernate - most popular one, takes a java object and maps java classes (ORM {object relational mapping}) to databases as tables, so we can perform
		    various operations

Reduces the amount of code that has to be written, gives us a lot of generated queries and access to our databases without having to write a single line of code
The implementation with Spring Boot applications is very simple and intuitive 

First we are starting with a bare Spring Boot project
pom.xml is a maven configuration file with e.g. dependencies, the only ones that i care about are org.springframework.boot and org.postgresql

in application.properties we have already some things set up for us, so that makes it easier:
spring.datasource.url - the url of the server
spring.datasource.username - username to connect to the database, no need to specify
spring.datasource.password - the password to the database account, no need to specify
