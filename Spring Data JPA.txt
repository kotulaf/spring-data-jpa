Spring Data JPA - Java Persistence API

implementations:
	hibernate - most popular one, takes a java object and maps java classes (ORM {object relational mapping}) to databases as tables, so we can perform
		    various operations

Reduces the amount of code that has to be written, gives us a lot of generated queries and access to our databases without having to write a single line of code
The implementation with Spring Boot applications is very simple and intuitive
